A To-do app made using Django is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, set due dates, and categorize tasks into different lists.

When a user logs into the app, they will see their list of tasks organized by due dates, with the tasks that are due soon appearing at the top of the list. They can then add new tasks by entering a task description and selecting a due date, and assign them to a specific list or category.

The app also allows users to mark tasks as complete, which will remove them from the main task list and add them to a completed task list. Users can also edit or delete tasks if they need to make changes.

The app is built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, which provides a powerful set of tools for building web applications quickly and efficiently. The app uses Django's built-in authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access their task lists.

Overall, a To-do app made using Django is a simple yet effective tool for managing tasks, designed to help users stay organized and productive.
